## Development

The document's structure is intended to mimic the [JavaScript binding section](https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#javascript-binding) of the Web IDL standard and take inspiration from [the Java binding for Web IDL](https://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL-Java/).

Some other prior art resources from how other ecosystems have started adopting Web IDL (or Web API bindings) into their own language idioms are the [web-sys](https://crates.io/crates/web-sys) crate from the Rust ecosystem and _TODO_.

You'll need to have [Bikeshed](https://speced.github.io/bikeshed/) installed to build the spec. You can quickly install Bikeshed using `pipx`:

```sh
pipx install bikeshed
```

Once you have Bikeshed installed you can use `bikeshed serve` to start a local dev server.

```sh
bikeshed serve
```

Currently the dev server does not live reload on changes. [speced/bikeshed#1674](https://github.com/speced/bikeshed/issues/1674)

Here's a quick rundown of Bikeshed markup:

- You can use _basic_ Markdown syntax in most places. If you can't then just use HTML `<a>`, `<i>`, etc. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- Use `<div class=example>` or `<p class=note>` to create automagic boxes with the fancy backgrounds.
- **`{{theThing}}`:** Autolink to the Web IDL definition of that symbol. Examples: `{{getSetCookie}}`, `{{Response/url}}`
- **`[[THE-SPEC inline]]`:** Automagically expands to the title of THE-SPEC. Examples: `[[FETCH inline]]`, `[[DOM inline]]`
- Use `<pre class=simpledef>` to make a quick colon `:` separated table
